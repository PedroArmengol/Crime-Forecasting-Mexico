FRONTEND (You need this to run our project even if you have a copy of our VM in the disk):
How to run the front end website using flask?

1. Go to the terminal
2. Go to the frontend folder (cd frontend)
3. run command: export FLASK_APP=flask_frontend_crime.py
4. run command: flask run
5. Go to your browser and type the address: 127.0.0.1:5000/
6. Voila! Play around with the website :)

PS: The website is giving some issues when you run the "predictive analytics part"
and we can't seem to figure that out. In order to run the predictive analytics part,
youu are encouraged to run it like this:

inside the backend/ repo:
ipython3
-run lasso_model.py
-frontend("homicides", 2008) as an example. You can select any type of crime
along with 4 years on which our Lasso predictive model is based i.e. 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011

We will resolve this issue ASAP.
