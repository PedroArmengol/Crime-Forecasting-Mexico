There are three main files in the frontend folder:


1. Templates folder: a folder for all the Jinja/html templates for Flask

2. Static: a javascript file for charts

3. flask_frontend_crime.py: A python file with the code to run the website



How to run the front end website using flask?

1. Go to the terminal

2. Go to the front_end folder (cd front_end)

3. run command: export FLASK_APP=flask_frontend_crime.py

4. run command: flask run

5. Voila! Play around with the website :)
